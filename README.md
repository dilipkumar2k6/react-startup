# react-startup
Start writing react code using storybook

## Steps
1. Clone it using `git clone https://github.com/dilipkumar2k6/react-startup.git`
2. Do `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Write your own react component in `src` folder. Create your own folder inside `src` to keep code organize
4. Add story i.e. usecase for your component to test it
5. Launch `http://localhost:9001` in your browser and test it.

Happy writing React code :-)
